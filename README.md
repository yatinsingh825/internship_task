🎯 Task 01 Completed – Linear Regression Implementation | Machine Learning Internship @ SkillCraft Technology

I’m pleased to share that I’ve successfully completed Task 01 of my Machine Learning internship at SkillCraft Technology, where I built a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using multiple independent features.

📌 Task Objective:
To construct a regression model capable of estimating house prices based on the following variables:
1️⃣ avg_income
2️⃣ avg_area_house_age
3️⃣ avg_area_num_rooms
4️⃣ avg_bedrooms
5️⃣ avg_population

🛠 Approach & Methodology:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and detect missing values, particularly in avg_income and avg_area_house_age

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare for model training

Built a Multiple Linear Regression model using scikit-learn

Extracted coefficients and intercept to analyze the impact of each feature

Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared Score

Visualized predictions with an Actual vs Predicted Price scatter plot to check model accuracy

📈 Key Outcomes:
✅ Achieved an R-squared Score of 0.92, indicating high predictive accuracy
✅ MSE: 10,551,140,753.59
✅ Found that avg_income and avg_area_num_rooms were the most influential features
✅ Scatter plot revealed strong model fit with minimal deviation from the regression line

💡 Skills & Insights Gained:

Experience in handling and preprocessing real-world datasets

Better understanding of feature importance and its effect on performance

In-depth knowledge of evaluation metrics like R² and MSE

Improved ability to visualize regression outcomes for model validation

Excited to apply these insights in the upcoming tasks and continue expanding my skills in Data Science and Machine Learning!
